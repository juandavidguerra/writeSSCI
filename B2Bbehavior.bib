We also describe the role of search and related algorithms, which for us turns into a recommendations problem as well. We explain the motivations behind and review the approach that we use to improve the recommendation algorithms, combining A/B testing focused on improving member retention and medium term engagement, as well as offline experimentation using historical member engagement data. We discuss some of the issues in designing and interpreting A/B tests. Finally, we describe some current areas of focused innovation, which include making our recommender system global and language aware.},

	abstract = {Autonomous driving is on the horizon. Vehicles with partially automated driving capabilities are already in the market. Before the widespread adoption however, human factors issues regarding automated driving need to be addressed. One of the key issues is how much drivers trust in automated driving systems and how they calibrate their trust and reliance based on their experience. In this paper, we report the results of a survey conducted with Tesla drivers about their experiences with two advanced driver assistance systems, Autopilot and Summon. We found that drivers have high levels of trust in Autopilot and Summon. Trust decreased with age for Autopilot but not for Summon. Drivers who experienced unexpected behaviors from their vehicles reported lower levels of trust in Autopilot. Over time, trust in these systems increased regardless of experience. Additionally, trust was correlated with several attitudinal and behavioral factors such as frequency of use, self-rated knowledge about these systems, and ease of learning. These findings highlight the importance of trust in real world use of autonomous cars. Also, the results suggest that previous findings on trust in automation are applicable to real world cases as well.},

	abstract = {Fraudulent claim detection is one of the greatest challenges the insurance industry faces. Alibaba’s return-freight insurance, providing return-shipping postage compensations over product return on the e-commerce platform, receives thousands of potentially fraudulent claims everyday. Such deliberate abuse of the insurance policy could lead to heavy financial losses. In order to detect and prevent fraudulent insurance claims, we developed a novel data-driven procedure to identify groups of organized fraudsters, one of the major contributions to financial losses, by learning network information. In this paper, we introduce a device-sharing network among claimants, followed by developing an automated solution for fraud detection based on graph learning algorithms, to separate fraudsters from regular customers and uncover groups of organized fraudsters. This solution applied at Alibaba achieves more than 80\% precision while covering 44\% more suspicious accounts compared with a previously deployed rule-based classifier after human expert investigations. Our approach can easily and effectively generalizes to other types of insurance.},

The present research extends this research by highlighting the role of choice complexity. It is argued that too-much-choice effects are associated with choice complexity, which is inﬂuenced not only by the number of alternatives, but also by other features of the choice set, such as the number of attributes that alternatives are differentiated upon. These other inﬂuences of choice complexity may propel or hinder the emergence of too-much-choice effects. Two experiments tested this hypothesis by orthogonally manipulating the number of alternatives and the number of attributes. Results revealed a too-much-choice effect when alternatives were differentiated on many attributes, but not when alternatives were differentiated on few attributes. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.},

	abstract = {Despite the voluminous evidence in support of the paradoxical ﬁnding that providing individuals with more options can be detrimental to choice, the question of whether and when large assortments impede choice remains open. Even though extant research has identiﬁed a variety of antecedents and consequences of choice overload, the ﬁndings of the individual studies fail to come together into a cohesive understanding of when large assortments can beneﬁt choice and when they can be detrimental to choice. In a meta-analysis of 99 observations (N = 7202) reported by prior research, we identify four key factors—choice set complexity, decision task difﬁculty, preference uncertainty, and decision goal—that moderate the impact of assortment size on choice overload. We further show that each of these four factors has a reliable and signiﬁcant impact on choice overload, whereby higher levels of decision task difﬁculty, greater choice set complexity, higher preference uncertainty, and a more prominent, effort-minimizing goal facilitate choice overload. We also ﬁnd that four of the measures of choice overload used in prior research—satisfaction/conﬁdence, regret, choice deferral, and switching likelihood—are equally powerful measures of choice overload and can be used interchangeably. Finally, we document that when moderating variables are taken into account the overall effect of assortment size on choice overload is signiﬁcant—a ﬁnding counter to the data reported by prior meta-analytic research.},

However, marketing research lacks an integrative conceptualization of this phenomenon. The authors address this void by conceptualizing a B2B supplier's marketing approaches to indirect customers. Drawing on a literature review and a qualitative empirical study, the authors identify three indirect customer marketing approaches: direct customer downstream support, cooperative indirect customer marketing, and independent indirect customer marketing. They also propose external (value chain–related) and internal (B2B supplier–related) moderators that influence the relationship between a B2B supplier's marketing approaches to indirect customers and its financial performance. The authors argue that although power constellations and product value contribution in the value chain determine the specific indirect customer marketing approach that will lead to financial success, internal professionalization of a B2B supplier's organizational structure and processes further strengthens the positive financial impact of each approach.},

This has been a consequence of the digitalization of artifacts, which has transmuted traditional businesses into digital forms. With the increasing digitalization and modularization of services, digital platforms have given many digital service providers possibilities to scale globally, and to rapidly transcend national borders by serving multi-sided markets. However, we still know very little about how digital platform providers actually internationalize their services, or how they make their platforms available for global markets. In this paper, we contribute to the increasing literature on digital-based INVs, examining how ﬁrms of this type internationalize their services, and more speciﬁcally, how recent technological developments have shaped the ﬁrms’ internationalization processes. Drawing on concepts from the network approach to internationalization, resource dependency theory, and INV theory, we extend the scope of INV theory via a model that encompasses the internationalization process of digital platform providers. We report on a longitudinal case study of a digital platform provider (covering the period 2000–2017), which allowed us to gain in-depth insight into the INV phenomenon.},

Today, human chat service agents are frequently replaced by conversational software agents or chatbots, which are systems designed to communicate with human users by means of natural language often based on artificial intelligence (AI). Though cost- and time-saving opportunities triggered a widespread implementation of AI-based chatbots, they still frequently fail to meet customer expectations, potentially resulting in users being less inclined to comply with requests made by the chatbot. Drawing on social response and commitment-consistency theory, we empirically examine through a randomized online experiment how verbal anthropomorphic design cues and the foot-in-the-door technique affect user request compliance. Our results demonstrate that both anthropomorphism as well as the need to stay consistent significantly increase the likelihood that users comply with a chatbot’s request for service feedback. Moreover, the results show that social presence mediates the effect of anthropomorphic design cues on user compliance.},

What if this standardized customization experience were personalized for consumers on the basis of how they process information? A series of large-scale field and experimental studies, conducted with Western and Eastern consumers, shows that matching the interface to consumers’ culture-specific processing style enhances the effectiveness of mass customization. Specifically, presenting the same information isolated (by attribute) to Western consumers but contextualized (by alternative) to Eastern consumers increases satisfaction with and likelihood of purchasing the configured product, along with the amount of money spent on the product. These positive consumer responses emerge because of an increase in “interface fluency”—consumers’ subjective experience of ease when using the interface. The authors advise firms to personalize the customization experience by employing processing-congruent interfaces across consumer markets.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionising the way customers interact with brands. There is a lack of empirical research into AI-enabled customer experiences. Hence, this study aims to analyse how the integration of AI in shopping can lead to an improved AI-enabled customer experience. We propose a theoretical model drawing on the trust-commitment theory and service quality model. An online survey was distributed to customers who have used an AI- enabled service offered by a beauty brand. A total of 434 responses were analysed using partial least squares-structural equation modelling. The findings indicate the significant role of trust and perceived sacrifice as factors mediating the effects of perceived convenience, personalisation and AI-enabled service quality. The findings also reveal the significant effect of relationship commitment on AI-enabled customer experience. This study contributes to the existing literature by revealing the mediating effects of trust and perceived sacrifice and the direct effect of relationship commitment on AI-enabled customer experience. In addition, the study has practical implications for retailers deploying AI in services offered to their customers.},

Drawing on this observation, the current study examines how customers’ service experiences with employees and AI influence customer engagement and loyalty. Customers’ emotional intelligence is proposed as a moderator between service experience and customer engagement. The study was conducted with hotel customers in Australia. The results show that whilst both service experience with employees and AI are significantly related to customer engagement and loyalty, only certain dimensions make significant unique variances in the outcome variables. The findings indicate that customers prefer employee service. These service experiences also have significant partial mediation effects on customer loyalty. Emotional intelligence has a significant moderation effect on customer engagement. Discussion of these findings and implications derived from this study concludes this paper.},

However, although AI can be seen as a neutral tool to be evaluated on efficiency and accuracy, this approach does not consider the social and individual challenges that can occur when AI is deployed. This research aims to bridge these two perspectives: on one side, the authors acknowledge the value that embedding AI technology into products and services can provide to consumers. On the other side, the authors build on and integrate sociological and psychological scholarship to examine some of the costs consumers experience in their interactions with AI. In doing so, the authors identify four types of consumer experiences with AI: (1) data capture, (2) classification, (3) delegation, and (4) social. This approach allows the authors to discuss policy and managerial avenues to address the ways in which consumers may fail to experience value in organizations’ investments into AI and to lay out an agenda for future research.},

Organizations, by definition, cannot achieve a pure, stable state and always go through various change processes, both incremental and radical changes.

AI-CRM leverages intelligent systems to automate the B2B relationship activities where the decision can be taken automatically without any human intervention. Relationship management in the B2B segment is considered a strategic activity of an organization. Moving from legacy to AI-CRM to facilitate B2B relationship management activities is an important decision, and proper implementation of AI-CRM is a critical success parameter for an organization. This study combines institutional theory and the resource-based view (RBV) in B2B relationship management to understand how AI-CRM could impact the firm's performance with varied firm size, firm age, and industry type.},

Additionally, we introduce a novel method to incorporate human judgments into the interpretation of machine-learned patterns, which allows us to measure diversification across multiple dimensions, such as products and geographies. Finally, we illustrate how these new measures can generate novel insights into the relationship between the degree and type of diversification and firm performance, furthering our understanding of the diversification–performance relationship.},

In particular, the contemporary economy stresses the relevance of digital transformation as a central driver towards innovation and business renewal, especially for established small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). However, little is known about the relationships among the above-mentioned growth paths, whether they are competing or complementary options. Our contribution addresses this gap focusing on two forms of organizational readiness within SMEs. First, it investigates the impact of Artificial Intelligence readiness on international performance. Second, it explores whether the relationship between digitalization and internationalization is affected by sustainability readiness. The empirical survey relies on a sample consisting of 438 SMEs, including both domestic and international companies. Findings confirm, as expected, that Artificial Intelligence readiness positively influences the international performance of SMEs. Moreover, we find that digitalization and sustainability are positively related, but they turn to be competing growth paths when the firm internationalizes..},

	abstract = {Despite the hype surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI), the potential of AI in customer relationship management (CRM) remains underexplored in academia. A between-subjects experiment examined the effects of the type of relationship (virtual assistantship versus virtual friendship) consumers build with AI-enabled chatbots on brand personality perception, parasocial interaction (PSI), and CRM. The main effects of the relationship type on brand personality perception appeared for competent brand personality, but not for sincere brand personality. The consumer-chatbot relationship type had effects on CRM-related outcomes (behavioral intention, satisfaction, and trust) through competent brand personality. Consumers who interacted with a friend chatbot experienced stronger PSI with the chatbot, and the relationship type had an influence on brand personality perception through PSI. This mediating effect of PSI was observed for both brand personalities - competence and sincerity. The moderating role of ideological views (technopians versus luddites) in explaining the effect of the relationship type on brand personality perception was detected for sincere brand personality. AI designers and marketers need to develop AI user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) along with marketing strategies that not only can appeal to technopians ready to adopt innovative AI customer representatives but also can ultimately help alleviate luddites’ AI anxiety in the emerging “feeling economy” envisioned by Rust and Huang.},

Practical and research applications of artiﬁcial intelligence tools have sometimes been limited by problematic biases (such as racism or sexism), which are often treated as uniform properties of the models. We show that the “algorithmic bias” within one such tool– the GPT-3 language model– is instead both ﬁne-grained and demographically correlated, meaning that proper conditioning will cause it to accurately emulate response distributions from a wide variety of human subgroups. We term this property algorithmic ﬁdelity and explore its extent in GPT-3. We create “silicon samples” by conditioning the model on thousands of socio-demographic backstories from real human participants in multiple large surveys conducted in the United States. We then compare the silicon and human samples to demonstrate that the information contained in GPT-3 goes far beyond surface similarity. It is nuanced, multifaceted, and reﬂects the complex interplay between ideas, attitudes, and socio-cultural context that characterize human attitudes. We suggest that language models with sufﬁcient algorithmic ﬁdelity thus constitute a novel and powerful tool to advance understanding of humans and society across a variety of disciplines.},

	abstract = {Driven by the need to provide continuous, timely, and efficient customer service, firms are constantly experimenting with emerging technological solutions. In recent times firms have shown an increased interest in designing and implementing artificial intelligence (AI)based interactional technologies, such as conversational AI agents and chatbots, that obviate the need for having human service agents for the provision of customer service. However, the business impact of conversational AI is contingent on customers using and adequately engaging with these tools. This engagement depends, in turn, on conversational AI’s similarity, or likeness to the human beings it is intended to replace. Businesses therefore need to understand what human-like characteristics and competencies should be embedded in customer-facing conversational AI agents to facilitate smooth user interaction. This focus on “human-likeness” for facilitating user engagement in the case of conversational AI agents is in sharp contrast to most prior information systems (IS) user engagement research, which is predicated on the “instrumental value” of information technology (IT). Grounding our work in the individual human competency and media naturalness literatures, we theorize the key role of humanlike interactional competencies in conversational AI agents—specifically, cognitive, relational, and emotional competencies—in facilitating user engagement. We also hypothesize the mediating role of user trust in these relationships. Following a sequential mixed methods approach, we use a quantitative two-wave, survey-based study to test our model. We then examine the results in light of findings from qualitative follow-up interviews with a sampled set of conversational AI users. Together, the results offer a nuanced understanding of desirable human-like competencies in conversational AI agents and the salient role of user trust in fostering user engagement with them. We also discuss the implications of our study for research and practice.},

However, frequent failures in human–chatbot conversations have led to consumer pushback. This study investigates the response of consumers to chatbots in terms of their intention to switch to human agents. Drawing upon the stimulus–organism–response (SOR) framework, focus is placed on how the anthropomorphic attributes of chatbots influence consumers’ perceived trust in chatbots and its implications for switching intention. Further, the moderating role of relationship norms in the relationships between the anthropomorphic attributes and trust in chatbots is examined. A mixed-methods approach is used; the qualitative analysis reveals three main anthropomorphic attributes of chatbots, two types of relationship norms and the specific response to chatbots. The quantitative results suggest that the anthropomorphic attributes of perceived warmth and perceived competence positively affect consumers’ perceived trust in chatbots, whereas communication delay negatively affects it. Relationship norms are found to moderate some of these effects such that exchange relationships strengthen the importance of perceived competence on trust, although communal relationships do not moderate the effects of perceived warmth on trust. Trust in chatbots negatively affects consumers’ intention to switch to a human agent. Theoretical and managerial implications are also discussed for scholars and practitioners in ways to improve the design and maximize the utility of chatbots.},

Our analysis shows that AI adoption triggers interrelated substitution and complementation dynamics, which make humans’ traditional competitive capabilities obsolete, while creating new sources of persistent heterogeneity when humans interact with chess engines. These novel human-machine capabilities are unrelated, or even negatively related, to traditional capabilities. We contribute an integrated view of substitution and complementation, which identifies AI as the driver of these dynamics and explains how they jointly shift the sources of competitive advantage.},

Probing language models provides a powerful new method for investigating media effects, has practical applications in supplementing polls and forecasting public opinion, and suggests a need for further study of the surprising ﬁdelity with which neural language models can predict human responses.},

Many tasks, however, are not performed by humans anymore but entirely by algorithms. In fact, consumers increasingly encounter algorithm-controlled products, such as robotic vacuum cleaners or smart refrigerators, which are steered by different types of algorithms. Building on insights from computer science and consumer research on algorithm perception, this research investigates how consumers respond to different types of algorithms within these products. This research compares high-adaptivity algorithms, which can learn and adapt, versus low-adaptivity algorithms, which are entirely preprogrammed, and explore their impact on consumers’ product preferences. Six empirical studies show that, in general, consumers prefer products with highadaptivity algorithms. However, this preference depends on the desired level of product outcome range—the number of solutions a product is expected to provide within a task or across tasks. The ﬁndings also demonstrate that perceived algorithm creativity and predictability drive the observed effects. This research highlights the distinctive role of algorithm types in the perception of consumer goods and reveals the consequences of unveiling the mind of the machine to consumers.},

	abstract = {Two studies tested the hypothesis that a Large Language Model (LLM) can be used to model psychological change following exposure to influential input. The first study tested a generic mode of influence - the Illusory Truth Effect (ITE) - where earlier exposure to a statement (through, for example, rating its interest) boosts a later truthfulness test rating. Data was collected from 1000 human participants using an online experiment, and 1000 simulated participants using engineered prompts and LLM completion. 64 ratings per participant were collected, using all exposure-test combinations of the attributes: truth, interest, sentiment and importance. The results for human participants reconfirmed the ITE, and demonstrated an absence of effect for attributes other than truth, and when the same attribute is used for exposure and test. The same pattern of effects was found for LLM-simulated participants. The second study concerns a specific mode of influence – populist framing of news to increase its persuasion and political mobilization. Data from LLM-simulated participants was collected and compared to previously published data from a 15-country experiment on 7286 human participants. Several effects previously demonstrated from the human study were replicated by the simulated study, including effects that surprised the authors of the human study by contradicting their theoretical expectations (anti-immigrant framing of news decreases its persuasion and mobilization); but some significant relationships found in human data (modulation of the effectiveness of populist framing according to relative deprivation of the participant) were not present in the LLM data. Together the two studies support the view that LLMs have potential to act as models of the effect of influence.},

First, we applied a prompt-based generative pre-trained transformer 3 (GPT-3) to generate personality items. This approach provides several practical advantages for researchers and practitioners compared to previous AIG approaches. Second, we thoroughly compared various psychometric properties between machine- and human-authored personality items. Lastly, we examined the measurement invariance of machineauthored personality items between gender groups to ensure fair organizational decision-making. Results revealed that the machine-authored personality items provided good psychometric properties and little measurement biases between genders.

We focus on the influence of two major types of human work experience (narrow experience based on the specific task volume and broad experience based on seniority) on the human-AI team dynamics. We developed an AI solution for medical chart coding in a publicly traded company and conducted a field study among the knowledge workers. Based on a detailed analysis performed at the medical chart level, we find evidence that AI benefits workers with greater task-based experience, but senior workers gain less from AI than their junior colleagues. Further investigation reveals that the relatively lower productivity lift from AI is not a result of seniority per se but lower trust in AI, likely triggered by the senior workers’ broader job responsibilities. This study provides new empirical insights into the differential roles of worker experience in the collaborative dynamics between AI and knowledge workers, which have important societal and business implications.},

            Autoregressive language models, which use deep learning to produce human-like texts, have surged in prevalence. Despite advances in these models, concerns arise about their equity across diverse populations. While AI fairness is discussed widely, metrics to measure equity in dialogue systems are lacking. This paper presents a framework, rooted in deliberative democracy and science communication studies, to evaluate equity in human–AI communication. Using it, we conducted an algorithm auditing study to examine how GPT-3 responded to different populations who vary in sociodemographic backgrounds and viewpoints on crucial science and social issues: climate change and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. We analyzed 20,000 dialogues with 3290 participants differing in gender, race, education, and opinions. We found a substantively worse user experience among the opinion minority groups (e.g., climate deniers, racists) and the education minority groups; however, these groups changed attitudes toward supporting BLM and climate change efforts much more compared to other social groups after the chat. GPT-3 used more negative expressions when responding to the education and opinion minority groups. We discuss the social-technological implications of our findings for a conversational AI system that centralizes diversity, equity, and inclusion.},

Leveraging the extensive literature on intertemporal discounting for benchmarking, we examine responses from LLMs across various languages and compare them with human responses, exploring preferences between smaller, sooner and larger, later rewards. Our findings reveal that both generative pretrained transformer (GPT) models demonstrate less patience than humans, with GPT-3.5 exhibiting a lexicographic preference for earlier rewards unlike human decision makers. Although GPT-4 does not display lexicographic preferences, its measured discount rates are still considerably larger than those found in humans. Interestingly, GPT models show greater patience in languages with weak future tense references, such as German and Mandarin, aligning with the existing literature that suggests a correlation between language structure and intertemporal preferences. We demonstrate how prompting GPT to explain its decisions, a procedure we term “chain-of-thought conjoint,” can mitigate, but does not eliminate, discrepancies between LLM and human responses. Although directly eliciting preferences using LLMs may yield misleading results, combining chain-of-thought conjoint with topic modeling aids in hypothesis generation, enabling researchers to explore the underpinnings of preferences. Chain-of-thought conjoint provides a structured framework for marketers to use LLMs to identify potential attributes or factors that can explain preference heterogeneity across different customers and contexts.},

Against this backdrop, a lab experiment was conducted to reveal the behavioral differences among different exploratory tasks through querying, clicking, scrolling and eye-tracking data. By operationalizing search motivation and cognitive complexity, exploratory tasks were categorized into four types: borderline learning, core learning, borderline investigation, and core investigation. 37 participants with good search ability completed the experiment, and the final dataset contains 124 observations from 31 participants. ANOVA tests showed that users performing investigation tasks generated longer queries, more satisfied clicks, less scrolling, more fixations within result areas, more interactions with social tags, and more frequent browsing of reviews than users performing learning tasks. Compared to core tasks, users had more queries when performing borderline tasks. Moreover, machine learning was conducted to validate whether different exploratory tasks can be distinguished through these behaviors. Gradient Boosting Machine allowed the correct classification of four exploratory tasks with 84.75 \% accuracy. The three most important indicators were UniQueryNum, MaxScrollDepth, and TagClickNum. By revealing differences in user behaviors for different exploratory tasks, this study advances the understanding of exploratory search behavior in knowledge communities at a finer granularity, and helps develop adaptive communities that support distinct exploratory tasks.},

Thus, our findings are among the first to demonstrate the potential for LLMs to automate, and thereby scale, the use of personalized persuasion in ways that enhance its effectiveness and efficiency.

	abstract = {This study explores the intersection of international business and artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on how new ventures navigate environmental challenges for international expansion within Africa's transportation sector. Despite a wealth of literature on AI in developed countries, a notable gap exists in the understanding of the challenges emerging economies face in implementing AI practices, particularly in the context of Africa-to-Africa internationalization. The current study delved into the transformative potential of AI, identifying institutional voids as opportunities for innovation on the continent. Employing the Technology Organization and Environment framework, the study investigated the adoption of AI technology in the African business environment. Qualitative data gathered through interviews with transport tech startup founders across Africa provided insights into technological innovation, institutional dynamics, and market peculiarities. The founders recognized hurdles such as data scarcity, human resource constraints, and regulatory obstacles amid institutional voids. The study underscores the importance of understanding expectations, balancing possibilities and realities, and fostering collaboration. It offers valuable insights into the complexities faced by and opportunities for new ventures leveraging AI in internationalization, with practical implications for strategic AI implementation, policy development, market expansion, technology solutions, and crossborder transportation within Africa's unique business landscape.},

	abstract = {In international business, firm-level language choices are important questions that require scarce organizational resources to deal with external stakeholders’ diverse preferences. While language choices have a major impact on the success and survival of SMEs, current knowledge of these choices is mainly based on data from MNEs, which constitutes a research gap. We help address this gap by exploring from a social exchange perspective why and how decision-makers in international small firms choose between “English-only” and “multilingual” approaches to language. We find that when evaluating the cost and benefits of these alternatives, decision-makers aim for high levels of both external and internal resource sharing. However, external language diversity and limited internal availability of relevant language competencies force them into difficult trade-offs.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly with the emergence of large language models (LLMs), have sparked a rethinking of artificial general intelligence possibilities. The increasing human-like capabilities of AI are also attracting attention in social science research, leading to various studies exploring the combination of these two fields. In this survey, we systematically categorize previous explorations in the combination of AI and social science into two directions that share common technical approaches but differ in their research objectives. The first direction is focused on AI for social science, where AI is utilized as a powerful tool to enhance various stages of social science research. While the second direction is the social science of AI, which examines AI agents as social entities with their human-like cognitive and linguistic capabilities. By conducting a thorough review, particularly on the substantial progress facilitated by recent advancements in large language models, this paper introduces a fresh perspective to reassess the relationship between AI and social science, provides a cohesive framework that allows researchers to understand the distinctions and connections between AI for social science and social science of AI, and also summarizes state-of-art experiment simulation platforms to facilitate research in these two directions. We believe that with the ongoing advancement of AI technology and the increasing integration of intelligent agents into our daily lives, the significance of the combination of AI and social science will become even more prominent.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to substitute for human participants in market research. Such LLMs can be used to generate text given a prompt. We argue that perceptual analysis is a particularly promising use case for such automated market research for certain product categories. The proposed new method generates outputs that closely match those generated from human surveys: agreement rates between human- and LLM- generated data sets reach over 75\%. Moreover, this applies for perceptual analysis based on both brand similarity measures and product attribute ratings. The paper demonstrates that, for some categories, this new method of fully or partially automated market research will increase the efficiency of market research by meaningfully speeding up the process and potentially reducing the cost. Further results also suggest that with an ever larger training corpus applied to large language models, LLM-based market research will be applicable to answer more nuanced questions based on demographic variables or contextual variation that would be prohibitively expensive or infeasible with human respondents.},
